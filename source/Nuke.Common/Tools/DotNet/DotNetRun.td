  "Help": "<p>The <c>dotnet run</c> command provides a convenient option to run your application from the source code with one command. It's useful for fast iterative development from the command line. The command depends on the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build\"><c>dotnet build</c></a> command to build the code. Any requirements for the build, such as that the project must be restored first, apply to <c>dotnet run</c> as well.</p><p>Output files are written into the default location, which is <c>bin/&lt;configuration&gt;/&lt;target&gt;</c>. For example if you have a <c>netcoreapp1.0</c> application and you run <c>dotnet run</c>, the output is placed in <c>bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.0</c>. Files are overwritten as needed. Temporary files are placed in the <c>obj</c> directory.</p><p>If the project specifies multiple frameworks, executing <c>dotnet run</c> results in an error unless the <c>-f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;</c> option is used to specify the framework.</p><p>The <c>dotnet run</c> command is used in the context of projects, not built assemblies. If you're trying to run a framework-dependent application DLL instead, you must use <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet\">dotnet</a> without a command. For example, to run <c>myapp.dll</c>, use: <c>dotnet myapp.dll</c></p><p>For more information on the <c>dotnet</c> driver, see the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/index\">.NET Core Command Line Tools (CLI)</a> topic.</p><p>In order to run the application, the <c>dotnet run</c> command resolves the dependencies of the application that are outside of the shared runtime from the NuGet cache. Because it uses cached dependencies, it's not recommended to use <c>dotnet run</c> to run applications in production. Instead, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/index\">create a deployment</a> using the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish\"><c>dotnet publish</c></a> command and deploy the published output.</p>",
